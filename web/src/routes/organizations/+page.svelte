            Also known as GDQ, this highly popular American organization hosts two main week-long events each year,
            <abbr title="Awesome Games Done Quick">AGDQ</abbr> and <abbr title="Summer Games Done Quick">SGDQ</abbr>.
            The former is held in the winter for the benefit of the
            <a href="https://preventcancer.org/">Prevent Cancer Foundation</a> while the latter is held in the summer
            for the benefit of <a href="https://doctorswithoutborders.org/">Doctors Without Borders</a>.
            GDQ also hosts two Frame Fatales events made by and for women and non-binary speedrunners each year for the
            benefit of the <a href="https://malala.org/">Malala Fund</a>.
        {:else if org.id === "esa"}
            ESA is the largest European speedrunning marathon and holds two events in Sweden each year. ESA Winter

            <a href="https://www.alzheimersgameover.com/">Alzheimerfonden</a>.
        {:else if org.id === "hek"}
            A spin-off of ESA started by the titular Hekigan, this incredibly silly marathon raises money for the same
            charities as ESA each year.
        {:else if org.id === "rpglb"}
            RPGLB holds an annual event all about RPGs for the benefit of the
