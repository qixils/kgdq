# KGDQ

A Kotlin/JVM client for reading data from the Games Done Quick
[donation tracker](https://github.com/GamesDoneQuick/donation-tracker).
Currently only reads from the v1 API.

The client currently contains various features for reducing duplicate requests
(i.e. ratelimits, caching of runners/hosts, etc).
Many of these features will likely be removed or changed significantly in the near future.
