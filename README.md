# KGDQ

This repository contains a collection of Kotlin modules used to fetch data from speedrunning
marathon-related APIs, such as GDQ donation trackers or Horaro schedules, and to display them in
various formats, such as a [public API](https://vods.speedrun.club/api/v1/events), a Discord bot,
a Reddit thread, and (hopefully) eventually a website. More information can be found in the
individual modules' READMEs.
