# KGDQ

This repository contains a collection of Kotlin modules used to fetch data from speedrunning marathon-related APIs,
such as GDQ donation trackers or Horaro schedules, and to display them in various formats, such as a public API,
a Discord bot, a Reddit thread, and a website. More information can be found in the individual modules' READMEs.
