# VODChat

A bot for posting the schedules of speedrunning marathon events in Discord channels.
This project is a continuation of [qixils/gdq-discord-schedule](https://github.com/qixils/gdq-discord-schedule).
It fetches its data from the [Speedrun VOD Club API](../api-server).
It is generally considered deprecated in favor of [Speedrun VOD Club](https://vods.speedrun.club) due to low usage and
various bizarre issues.
